## Welcome

Here you will find a bunch of scripts that I use to automate my home.

I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, and Pi Zeros at home along with a bunch of "smart" devices of various brands. All these smart devices work great independently but not together. My goal is to bring all of them together and have them talk to each other with a little bit of programming and make them really smarter as a whole! I also want to be able to run all the software on Raspberry Pi's only.

The primary Home Automation software/platform that I use is [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) (HA). It is an open-source home automation platform written by a bunch of smart individuals. HA allows you to track and control devices easily with simple configuration and with a little bit of scripting, you can do wonders. It is also a perfect piece of software to run entirely on a single Raspberry Pi.

The following picture shows high level architecture of my home network, and what I use for basic automation stuff.

Please feel free to let me know if you find any issues with my code, and/or have any suggestions. Thank you!

**Devices I have currently:**

* Wemo Switches

* TP Link HS-200 Switches

* Wemo Outlets

* Eteckcity RF Outlets

* Lifx Bulbs

* Philips Hue Bulbs

* Sharp Aquos Smart TV

* Onkyo Receiver (TX-NR 807)

* Home Security System

* Ring Door Bell Pro

* Nest Protect (Smoke and CO Monitor)

* Aeotec ZWave Z-Stick Gen 5 (ZW090)

* Aeotec ZWave Multi Sensors (5 in 1) - Gen 5

* Aeotec ZWave Multi Sensors (6 in 1) - Gen 5

* Ecobee Garage Door Tilt Sensors

* Ecobee Door & Window Sensors

* Leeo Smoke and CO Remote Alarm Monitor

* Lutron Motion Sensors (Single Pole and 3-Way Switches) 

* Amazon Dash Buttons

* Bunch of Raspberry Pi's

* Bunch of Pi Zero's

* Cheap Bluetooth speakers from Amazon

* Radio Frequency Transmitters and Receivers ( RioRand 433 MHz Superheterodyne RF

* Sensor kit from Raspberry Pi for experimentation - 

* Custom Built Smart outlet - where I used a PiZero and relay switch to turn ON/OFF the electrical outlet. I made a small wooden box to house all the items. It is a poor man's version of smart electrical outlet, but a very smart one, and I have more control over this outlet than the commercial smart outlets.
